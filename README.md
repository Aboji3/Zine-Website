Goals
 Take the carousel section from the "Luna theme" and input it into the "Ranger theme". 

Find the HTML, that structures the carousel. 
Figure out what CSS is modifying the carousel so it looks that way (also how bigcartel stores imagery?)

Possible issue, the carousels database for imagery is based on the theme, so the opposite may need to be done. 
Instead taking the luna theme, modifying the navigation and body to match the ranger...but that would need to be done for each page....
